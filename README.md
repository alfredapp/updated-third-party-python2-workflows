# Updated Third-Party Python 2 Workflows

With macOS Monterey 12.3, Apple [removed the bundled Python 2 interpreter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-12_3-release-notes#Python). That means older Workflows dependent on Python 2 will no longer work without modification.

That’s what this repository is for. It contains existing third-party Python 2 Workflows tweaked so you can keep using them until they are updated by their developers or you switch to an alternative. If a Workflow you use isn’t present, request it [here](https://github.com/alfredapp/updated-third-party-python2-workflows/issues/new) or on the forum.

Before installing any of these, you **must** install Python 2 to a location recognised by Alfred. Follow [the knowledge base article](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/kb/python-2-monterey/).

**WARNING:** All Workflows on this repository are made by third-parties. They were modified just enough to keep working but *their contents have not been audited* so make sure you trust the original author.

All Workflows retain their original license.
